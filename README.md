# hangman-mini-project
another mini project on C

# why C
i wnated to get better at understanding this programming langague.
even if i never have to use it, understanding the fundementals of computers and programming languages come from this langague.

# what are the basics?
its hangman

## the function
- It will read a text file with a few random words
- read the user's input (has to be a letter)
- checking
  - if cirrect, it gets added to the line
  - if not, it will draw a section (or spell hangman as your game over phase)

## overall
its a simple game that will can be even more simple in Java or Python (my main langagues that is not react or any frontend langague)
